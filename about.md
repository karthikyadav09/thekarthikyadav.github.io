Some information about you!

Hi there stranger! As you can see, I love to create random stuff. I am currently living in Tokyo and I am passionate about cooking (huge fan of thai curries now), writing and doing side projects with friends.


I also love playing dota2, badminton and kickboxing. Do drop a message on your thoughts or if you want to collaborate on any projects.
