Some information about you!

Hi there stranger! As you can see, I love to create random stuff. I am currently living in San Diego and I am passionate about cooking (huge fan of thai curries now), writing and doing side projects with friends.

I am a Masters in Computer Science student (expected graduation: 2023) at UC San Diego. I have 3 years of professional experience in Software engineering working with Big Data, Distributed Systems OAuth, and OIDC. I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad.

I am passionate about Software Engineering and Big Data Technologies. 


### More Information

I also love playing dota2, badminton and kickboxing. Do drop a message on your thoughts or if you want to collaborate on any projects.
